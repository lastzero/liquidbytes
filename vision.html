<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>The past involvement in some of the most exciting software projects enables Michael to do massive code refactorings
    when needed, to keep deadlines and to show other developers how to work more efficiently. He is also a core team
    member at
    <a href="http://www.javascriptmvc.com/">JavaScriptMVC</a>, an open-source JavaScript framework containing
    the best ideas in enterprise JavaScript development.
</p>
<p>
    Tools like these, together with agile methodologies, deliver clean code faster while extending the scope
    of what web applications can offer in terms of functionality and usability.
